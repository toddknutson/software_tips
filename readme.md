## Rclone

`rclone` is like `rsync` for transferring data between cloud platforms (e.g. panasas, ceph, Google Drive, etc.).


[`rclone` examples](rclone.sh)


## GNU Screen

I use GNU Screen to manage my ssh connections to MSI. This way, if my network connection breaks, or I need to bring my laptop to a meeting, my MSI interactive session can continue running in the background. I can even reconnect to that session.

[`screen` examples](gnu_screen.md)
